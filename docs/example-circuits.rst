Example circuits
================

This page collects example codes which mainly demonstrate the :ref:`lucipy-comp` machinery
but also touches other parts of the lucipy library.
Note that this are currently not nicely prepared examples
but more or less work benches demonstrating how to configure a circuit and to simulate it
numerically or run it on real LUCIDACs. If not noted otherwise, the example codes are working.


:download:`Rössler <../examples/roessler.py>`
   Rössler attractor on LUCIDAC, as from 
   `Analog Paradigm Application Note 1 <https://analogparadigm.com/downloads/alpaca_1.pdf>`_.
   Coincidentally, see this example in a very similar notation also in the several-years old
   `PyAnalog FPAA YML <https://github.com/anabrid/pyanalog/blob/master/examples/fpaa-circuits/Alpaca01-Roessler-Attractor.yml>`_.

:download:`Lorenz <../examples/lorenz.py>`
   Lorenz attractor on LUCIDAC, as from 
   `Analog Paradigm Application Note 2 <https://analogparadigm.com/downloads/alpaca_2.pdf>`_.

:download:`Hindmarsh-Rose <../examples/hindmarsh-rose-neuron.py>`
   Single Spiking Neuron Model on LUCIDAC, as from 
   `Analog Paradigm Application Note 28 <https://analogparadigm.com/downloads/alpaca_28.pdf>`_.

We plan to show better examples as Jupyter Notebooks where one can see graphs, math, etc. all
on one page.
